									<p>Hi! My name is Lordrick, I was born in Arusha, Tanzania, and studied physics at the University of Dodoma, Tanzania. 
										I graduated in 2022 and moved to the USA in 2023 to pursue a PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of California Santa Cruz.</p>
									<p>I am passionate about using signals to explore the structure of the universe. 
										Currently, my main focus is on Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) and how they can help us to study baryon distributions and trace dark matter in galactic halos.
										 I am also interested in using FRBs as a way to understand the cosmos. </p>
									<p>Although there were few research opportunities in my home country, 
										my passion for astronomy drove me to seek opportunities internationally. 
										Fortunately, I was warmly welcomed and given the chance to pursue my lifelong dream of becoming an astrophysicist.
										 I hope to inspire students, particularly those from underrepresented communities, to never give up on their aspirations.</p>

										<p>My current research project is investigating the <b>disequilibrium of
									the Milky Way (MW).</b> All-sky surveys have mapped the disk and halo of the Galaxy,
									 and these surveys have uncovered inhomoegenity in the spatial 
									 and kinematic distribution of the stars in the MW disk and 
									 stellar streams and the wake of major mergers in the halo.
									  A large gravitational perturbation in the past has resulted in 
									  observational evidence that the MW in the stages of returning to equilibrium.
									  </p>
									
									
									<p>I am currently using spectroscopic data from <a href="https://www.desi.lbl.gov/">DESI</a> to study the inhomogeneities of 
									the Milky Way disk to decipher how it evolved to its present state.
									Previous studies have used K and M dwarf stars from Gaia and SDSS to probe the region
									2 kpc above and below the galactic plane in the local region. We will use DESI to go beyond this region to
									see if the inhomogeneity continues further out, and apply this knowledge to the stellar halo. </p>

									versus the vertical position of the stars from the galactic plane at 8kpc from the center of the

											<p>  I developed analysis software to identify <b>nucleated low surface brightness galaxies</b>, 
									specifically ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs),
									 and measure the properties of their nuclear sources. The goal was to measure the incidence
									  of nuclear clusters in these galaxies and to uncover any galaxy properties that led to
									   an increased incidence rate. The properties of the nuclear core will also be used to constrain
									    models for the formation and evolution of these cores.</p>

										<p>  At University of Arizona and with collaborators at Penn State, I worked on 
										Transiting Exoplanet Satellite Survey (TESS) exoplanet follow-up characterization. 
										I used ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy
									  from HPF to measure radial velocities and <b>characterize both the host star and exoplanet.</b>
									I specifically worked on characterizing a system, labeled TOI-5375. I modeled the orbital parameters,
									 mass, and radius of the target, and concluded the companion is a very low-mass star (VLMS) at the hydrogen-burning limit and is only 400 Myrs old.

												<h4><a href="outreach.html"><u>Outreach</u></a></h4>
												<p>Outreach is a fulfilling part of being a researcher because it's awesome 
												being able to connect with the community over astronomy! Teaching students (and
												parents) about the constellations or planets will always bring me joy!

												<p>I've always loved creating stuff with my hands since I was a child and my

												<p>My favorite way to stay active is through hiking! Arizona had many beautiful hiking
